> How to add custom configuration without messing the local repository

## For the shell itself

You can add anything you want (secret stuff, for example), to the `~/.localrc`
file.

## For git

You can just change the default `~/.gitconfig` file, since it includes the
dotfiles managed one.

## For psql

You can edit the `~/.psqlrc.local` file.

## What about the others?

Until now, it was not problem. If it becomes a problem for you, feel free
to open an issue or a pull request, I'll be happy to take a look at it!
